# STAT-545B-Assignments

Hi, welcome to my Github repository of STAT 545B Assignments! Here we explore use of R scripts and other powerful tools to perform clean data analysis.

In this (unfinished) repository we will have four main folders, one for each 545B assignment. Each folder contains the source code and output .md file for our visitor to view. 

Currently the first assignment folder is finished.
